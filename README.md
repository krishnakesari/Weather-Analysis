# Weather-Analysis

Weather data camptured from Lake Pend Orieille in North Idaho

Data variables: date, time, air temperature, barometric pressure, dew point, and others.

Task 1. Writing a function that accepts a beginning date and time and an ending date and time.
Inclusive of those dates and times, return the coefficient of the slope of the barometric pressure.

Task 2. Generate a graph on weather pattern


Logic: A rising slope indicates an increasing barometric pressure, which typically means fair and sunny weather ahead. A falling slope indicates a decreasing barometric pressure, which typically means stormy weather.
